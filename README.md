# Behavioral-Analysis


This repository is dedicated to the data analysis of behavioral experiments. These experiments include goal-directed lever-reaching tasks in rats as well as mice engaged in locomotion tasks during different experimental conditions such as *brain lesion* or *optogenetic manipulations*. 

The data for this project is provided through different pipelines. Temporal position of body parts are tracked using [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut), a package for markerless pose estimation of user-defined features with deep learning for all animals. Whereas the information provided by the experiment chamber itself is processed with this interactive [code](https://github.com/Shiva-A-Lindi/Behavioral-Analysis/LED_detection) developed using CV2 Python package. The step-by-step guide is provided [here]().
