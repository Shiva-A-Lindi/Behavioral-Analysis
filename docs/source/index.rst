This package consists data analysis tools for two different behavioral tasks. A Locomotion task where animals are continously running on a treadmill while being subjected to optogenetic stimulation. 
Another task is lever reaching task where the animal has to follow the auditory cues presented in the experiment chamber and reach and press a lever to receive reward. There are numerous protocols for this task where the animal would be either lesioned, chemogentically or optogenetically manipulated.
